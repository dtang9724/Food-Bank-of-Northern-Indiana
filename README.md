# Food-Bank-of-Northern-Indiana

This is a consulting project that I did in a team of four for Food Bank of Northern Indiana. In this project, we consulted the clients about their concerns with the problems of food waste and imbalanced food distribution. We analyzed the root causes, which were 1) excess food must be distributed (in order to cut transportation and storage costs) and 2) the demand for each mobile pantry program was very hard to predict. And we used decision tree and random forest to extract predictive factors that would explain the number of individuals coming to the mobile pantry. We embeded our work results in the forms of a Shiny App in R and an Excel spreadsheet so that the client could easily access our predictions.
