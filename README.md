# Food-Bank-of-Northern-Indiana

This is a consulting project that I did in a team of four for the Food Bank of Northern Indiana. In this project, we consulted the client about their concerns with the mobile food pantry program that the client deployed in 6 counties of northern Indiana. The main problems were  food waste and imbalanced food distribution in different counties. After understanding the client's business model and the problem scope, we analyzed the root causes of the problems, which were 1) excess food must be distributed (in order to cut transportation and storage costs) and 2) the demand for each mobile pantry program was very hard to predict. We did some descriptive analyses using R and Tableau to help the client understand our findings.

To solve the problems, we used decision tree and random forest to extract predictive factors that would explain the number of individuals coming to the mobile pantry. We presented our work results in the forms of a Shiny App in R and an Excel spreadsheet so that the client could easily access our predictions for their reference.

This .pdf file is the slides that we presented to the executive director of the Food Bank of Northern Indiana on 01/24/2020 at client's site. The client adopted our approach and expected to use our tools in the future to improve the program management.
